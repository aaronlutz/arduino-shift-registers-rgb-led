# Controlling RGBs LEDs with an Arduino and Shift Registers

## May 15th 2019
* Project Added to GitHub
* Able to control RGB LEDs through multiple shift registers
* Shift Registers output HIGH or LOW
* Limited to 8 possible colors/states for each LED
  * Teal
  * Pink
  * Yellow
  * Blue
  * Green
  * Red
  * White
  * Off
* The shift registers I have don't natively support pulse wave modulation (PMW)
* I plan to add PMW to open up the full RGB colors space
